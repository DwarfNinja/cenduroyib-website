        This website was started by me during the summer holiday of 2021 and has been built to be my personal portfolio since then.
        Originally this website was built with vanilla <b><i>HTML</i></b>, <b><i>CSS</i></b> and <b><i>Javascript</i></b> but has
        later on been fully rebuilt and redesigned with <b><i>Vue.js</i></b>, <b><i>TailwindCSS</i></b> and utilizes <b><i>Vite</i></b> for building and deployment.
        Furthermore the site makes use of a few different libraries:
        <b><i>AOS</i></b>, <b><i>Typewriter.js</i></b> and a personally modified version of <b><i>VanillaTilt.js</i></b>.<br>
        I hope you enjoyed!
